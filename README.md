# AWS-VPC-EC2-distributed-whiteboard-application
 Developing a distributed whiteboard application and hosting it on Private Cloud


I created a simple whiteboard application where multiple users can use the application concurrently. This application was developed using HTML, Angularjs and springboot. It was hosted using AWS cloud stack, using a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in multiple Availability Zones(AZ) and Elastic Loadbalancer was implemented to maintain consistency, scalability and quality of service.

Tech used: AWS EC2 instances, Security Groups, Elastic Load Balancer, AWS CloudWatch, Amazon Machine Images(AMI)
